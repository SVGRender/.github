## 🌟 About Us

Pytorch-SVGRender is an open-source initiative dedicated to differentiable rendering for SVG generation.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between raster and vector graphics using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques,
empowering designers, researchers, and developers with powerful tools for image vectorization, text-to-SVG synthesis,
and SVG editing.

## 🔥 What's New?

- [03/2024] 🎉 We officially launched our organization!
- [12/2023] 🚀 Pytorch-SVGRender V1.0 is now open-source!
